Hello, how are you? How are you doing? I am going to go to the gym later, would you like to join me?
I was relaxing with my friends yesterday and we had a wonderful time.
I have to finish this work as soon as possible, my boss is very strict about deadlines.
I am trying to learn coding but it is somewhat difficult, to be honest.
My phone is malfunctioning, I need to get it fixed for real.
That movie was very good, we should definitely watch it again.
I am feeling somewhat tired, I probably need more sleep to be honest.
Can you let me know when you are free? We could get some food.
My computer is not working properly, I might need to restart it.
That test was somewhat impossible, I do not know how anyone passed.
